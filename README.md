# Tran

An implementation of the Tran programming language.

Tran is an object-oriented language that has some significant differences from other languages that you may know of. The biggest differences are:

1. Tran methods can have multiple return types.
2. Tran doesnâ€™t use curly braces `{ }` for blocks, instead it uses indentation.
3. Tran while/for/do-while loops are much simpler than Java or C loops.
4. Tran variables are private unless otherwise specified by an accessor or mutator keyword.
5. Tran uses the keyword shared to represent static methods; it can be used for variables, but it cannot be used for classes.
